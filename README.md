# Overview

An exploration of classifying imbalanced data in Python, with focus placed on tools and functions from the `sklearn` and `imbalanced-learn` packages. Includes topics such as cost-sensitive learning, precision-recall curves, and rebalancing techniques such as SMOTE, ADASYN, and random over/under-sampling.
